## Recommendation
Based on the analysis visualized in the Amazon Product Review Dashboard, the following recommendations are made:
   - Categories with high potential revenue but fewer reviews should be targeted for increased visibility and engagement.
   - Products with 1â€“2-star ratings need urgent attention. Analyze negative feedback to know the exact issues with the products and also work on products improvement.
   - Encourage customers with discounted incentives or follow -up emails to encourage more reviews, especially for under-reviewed categories.
   - Products with 4-5stars rating reflect customer satisfaction. Such products can be featured on products pages and marketing materials to reinforce trust and to gain more customers.
